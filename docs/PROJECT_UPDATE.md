## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
1. **Component-First Development**
   - Break screens into small, focused components
   - Keep files under 300 lines
   - Use proper widget hierarchy

2. **State Management**
   - Local state for UI-only states
   - Quiz state for question/answer flow
   - Results state for character determination

3. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Add debug prints for state changes
   - Log user interactions
   - Document edge cases

### Best Practices
1. Follow Material Design 3 guidelines
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Use const constructors where possible
4. Keep business logic in services
5. Document complex algorithms

### Dependency Management
- Minimize external dependencies
- Use Flutter built-in widgets when possible
- Document required dependencies

### File Organization
- Components go in screen-specific component folders
- Shared widgets go in widgets folder
- Business logic goes in services folder

## 📝 Documentation Guidelines
1. Add comments for complex logic
2. Update PROJECT_UPDATE.md for major changes
3. Keep README.md current
4. Document setup requirements

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Import Errors**
   - Check file structure
   - Verify import paths
   - Use proper package imports

2. **State Management**
   - Use setState for local UI
   - Implement ChangeNotifier for complex state
   - Keep state close to usage

3. **Build Errors**
   - Run flutter clean
   - Check pubspec.yaml
   - Verify Flutter version

4. **UI Issues**
   - Use LayoutBuilder for responsiveness
   - Handle edge cases
   - Test on different screen sizes
