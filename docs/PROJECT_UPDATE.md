## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Important Notes for Contributors
1. **ALWAYS Push Directly to GitHub**
   - Use create_or_update_file for all changes
   - Ignore GitHub API errors in responses
   - Never create local-only implementations

2. **Flutter-First Approach**
   - No React/Web approaches
   - Use Flutter's built-in widgets when possible
   - Follow Material Design 3 guidelines

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep files small and focused
   - Use proper Flutter structure
   - Add debug logs for development

4. **State Management**
   - Use simple state management for now
   - Prepare for potential Provider/Riverpod implementation

### File Locations for New Features
- New questions: `lib/data/questions.dart`
- UI components: `lib/widgets/`
- Screen layouts: `lib/screens/`
- Models: `lib/models/`
- Utils: `lib/utils/`

### Essential Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_fonts: ^6.1.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
```

## 🎮 Question Guidelines
- Keep questions engaging but concise
- Follow D&D attribute style
- Maintain balance between attributes
- Include both single and multiple choice
- Add personality assessment elements

## 🤝 Getting Started with Development
1. Read all documentation in `/docs`
2. Check current implementation in `lib/`
3. Use GitHub API for all file changes
4. Follow the Flutter-first approach
5. Add debug logs for development
6. Verify repository changes after updates

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Creating local implementations
2. Using React/Web approaches
3. Skipping debug logs
4. Missing repository verification
5. Implementing complex state management
6. Adding unnecessary dependencies

### Example Implementation Path
1. Review `/docs/PROJECT_UPDATE.md`
2. Check existing files before changes
3. Use create_or_update_file for changes
4. Add debug logs
5. Verify changes in repository
6. Update documentation
