# QuizDumb Project Status

## Recent Updates

### Flutter Migration & Cleanup
- Identified and removed React components/structure
- Consolidated to proper Flutter/Dart structure
- Removed src/ directory and React dependencies
- Established proper lib/ directory structure for Flutter

### Current Project Structure
```
lib/
  ├── models/
  │   ├── question.dart     # Question data structure
  │   └── result.dart       # Results calculation model
  ├── screens/
  │   ├── quiz_screen.dart  # Main quiz interface
  │   ├── welcome_screen.dart
  │   └── results_screen.dart
  └── widgets/             # Reusable components
      └── question_card.dart

assets/                    # Images, fonts, etc.
docs/                     # Project documentation
```

## Current Status

### Working Features
- Basic quiz flow with two questions
- Question selection
- Basic navigation between questions
- Debug logging for quiz progression

### Known Issues
1. Progress Bar Missing
   - Need to implement proper progress indication
   - Should show current question number / total questions

2. Question Flow
   - Currently requires manual "Next" button press
   - Should auto-progress after single-choice selection
   - Keep "Next" only for multiple-choice questions

3. Visual Updates Needed
   - Background gradient implementation
   - Consistent styling across screens
   - Animations for transitions

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Always Push to GitHub
- Do NOT create local-only implementations
- Use create_or_update_file for new files
- Ignore API errors - changes still go through
- Verify changes in repository after pushes

### 2. Question Implementation
Questions should:
- Auto-progress after single-choice selection
- Show clear visual feedback when selected
- Include attribute scoring
- Have encouraging messages between questions

### 3. File Organization
- Keep models in lib/models/
- Screens in lib/screens/
- Reusable widgets in lib/widgets/
- Assets in assets/ directory

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement auto-progression
2. Add progress bar
3. Fix background gradient
4. Add more questions
5. Implement proper scoring system

### Future Features
1. Results visualization
2. Achievement badges
3. Social sharing
4. Progress saving
5. Detailed recommendations

## Getting Started (For New Contributors)

### Key Points
1. This is a Flutter project - no React/Web components
2. Always push directly to GitHub, don't create local files
3. Ignore GitHub API errors in Claude's responses
4. Check actual repository for successful changes
5. Follow the established directory structure

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Don't create React components
2. Don't implement features locally first
3. Don't skip testing on actual devices
4. Don't mix web and mobile styling

### Required Tools
- Flutter SDK
- Dart
- VS Code or Android Studio
- Flutter DevTools for debugging

## Question Guidelines
Questions should:
1. Feel like personality assessments
2. Be engaging and concise
3. Have clear attribute connections
4. Progress smoothly
5. Provide immediate feedback

## Technical Notes
- Use setState() for state management
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow Flutter best practices
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document complex logic
