# QuizDumb Project Update

## Current Status & Next Steps

### 1. Question Improvements
- Implement 16 Personalities-style scale questions
  - Replace current 1-3 numeric scale with agree/disagree spectrum
  - Add visual indicators (colors, sizes) for scale positions
- Add rich answer formats
  ```dart
  // Example format for answers with descriptions
  {
    'text': 'Curiosity',
    'description': 'I love figuring out how stuff works!',
    'attributes': {'Intelligence': 2, 'Wisdom': 1}
  }
  ```
