# QuizDumb Development Prompt

## Overview
QuizDumb is a Flutter app that helps users discover their character class through a D&D-inspired personality quiz. The app features engaging animations, haptic feedback, and detailed personality insights.

## Current Focus
We are building the next iteration of features focusing on:
1. Enhanced character class determination
2. Detailed personality insights
3. Polished animations and transitions
4. Social sharing capabilities

## Development Requirements

### Key Points
1. This is a Flutter/Dart project, NOT React/Web
2. Push changes directly to GitHub using create_or_update_file
3. Ignore GitHub API errors in responses
4. Follow the lib/ directory structure
5. Keep files small and modular
6. Include debug logs
7. Always verify repository changes

### Repository Structure
```
lib/
  ├── data/       # Data layer
  ├── models/     # Domain models
  ├── providers/  # State management
  ├── screens/    # UI components
  ├── services/   # Business logic
  └── widgets/    # Shared widgets
```

### Common Tasks
1. **Adding New Features**
   - Check existing implementations
   - Create modular components
   - Add proper debug logging
   - Update documentation

2. **UI Updates**
   - Follow Material Design 3
   - Use consistent styling
   - Implement proper animations
   - Add haptic feedback

3. **State Management**
   - Keep state close to usage
   - Use appropriate scoping
   - Document state flow
   - Handle edge cases

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating New Components
1. Create component file in appropriate directory
2. Add debug logging
3. Implement error handling
4. Add documentation
5. Update relevant test files

### Modifying Existing Code
1. Check current implementation
2. Make incremental changes
3. Test functionality
4. Update documentation

### Adding New Features
1. Plan component structure
2. Create necessary files
3. Implement core logic
4. Add UI components
5. Test functionality

## Common Issues to Avoid
1. Creating React components
2. Local-only implementations
3. Missing debug logs
4. Mixed Flutter/Web approaches
5. Skipping repository verification

## Example Implementation Steps
1. Review current code
2. Plan changes
3. Create/update files
4. Add debug logging
5. Test functionality
6. Update documentation

## Important Notes
- Remember this is a Flutter project

## Repository Verification
After making changes:
1. Check file structure
2. Verify imports
3. Test functionality
4. Update documentation
5. Commit changes

## Character Class System
The app uses a D&D-inspired system with:
- 6 primary attributes
- Multiple character classes
- Balanced scoring system
- Personality insights

## Next Development Areas
